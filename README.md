# Intro to coding

This is a 2-hour course to help you get started in web development. As you can imagine, it's not possible to cover everything in just two hours so I've distilled it to just the essentials. I've also left some learning resources that you can follow up on after the course. 

The aim of this course is to give you a cursory introduction to

- how the web works,
- the components of a web page (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and
- to build your very own web page on [Codepen](https://codepen.io)

## The internet and the world wide web

## HTML basics

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. Sounds fancy and it might even look intimidating, but we're going to see that HTML is nothing more than just plain text. 

### Looking under the hood

Let's look under the hood to see how this web page was built. Right click on this web page and select **Inspect** (some browsers might show **Inspect Element**). Locate the text "Intro to coding," it should look something like

```html
<h1>Intro to coding</h1>
```

HTML is not a programming language; it's just plain text with a bit of markup.

## CSS basics

CSS is also not a programming language; it's just a set of rules that the browser uses to style its content.

## JavaScript basics

JavaScript is a programming language and it's the only one your web browser understands. Just like there are numerous languages in the world, there are also numerous programming languages out there. You might have heard of programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java\*, or even C++, but only JavaScript can be interpreted by the browser. 

\* JavaScript is not Java. They are both programming languages, but they are entirely different and completely unrelated. Remeber, Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpenter. ðŸ˜‚
